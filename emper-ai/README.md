## 🚀 Overview

**Emper.ai** is an end-to-end AI-driven recruitment platform that enables fast, intelligent matchmaking between recruiters and job seekers — completely over WhatsApp.

Developed solo from scratch, Emper.ai lets recruiters submit free-form job prompts like:

> _"I need a cook who can also manage groceries for ₹7,000 per month and is okay working in Nagpur."_

The system uses GPT-based logic to:
- Interpret the job prompt
- Match relevant candidate profiles from the database
- Send automated recommendations via WhatsApp or email
